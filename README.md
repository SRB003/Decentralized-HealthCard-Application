# Hackanova_Disruptors

# Welcome to our Decentralized HealthCard Application repository
This repository contains the code for our decentralized application (DApp) which is made with Infura, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our DApp allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain without the need to run a local node.

# Getting Started
* To get started, you will need to have a web3.js library and a Metamask browser extension installed.

* You will also need to create an account on Infura to get the endpoint to connect to the Ethereum network.

* Once you have these dependencies set up, you can clone this repository and install the necessary packages .



# Interacting with the Decentralized HealthCard Application
You can interact with the DApp by running a local server using http-server or live-server and connect to the Ethereum network using Infura and web3.js.

# Additional Information
Smart Contract Our DApp utilizes a smart contract that is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract code can be found in the repository.

#  Resources Used
